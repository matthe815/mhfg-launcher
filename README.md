- Allows you to download your character

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/rockisch/mhf-launcher/releases/latest) and drop it in the same folder as `mhf.exe`.

Note that the launcher requires your `mhfo-hd.dll` to be decrypted. Most community releases in the wild already do that, so it probably won't be an issue.

## Supported Servers

For now, only servers using the latest version of [this fork](https://github.com/rockisch/Erupe-1) will work with the new launcher.
